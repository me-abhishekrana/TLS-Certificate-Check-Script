**This Bash script is designed to check the SSL certificate expiration dates for a list of websites and generate an HTML report with a color-coded table indicating the status of each certificate based on the number of days until expiration.**

Here's a breakdown of the script:

**1. Define Websites and Variables**

        - An array named websites is defined with the URLs to be checked.
        
        - The SSL port is specified as **SSL_PORT_ADDRESS**.
        
        - The output HTML file is specified as **output_file**.
        
        - The current date and time are captured in **current_date_time**.

**2. Initialize HTML File**

        - The script creates an HTML file and initializes it with a header and a table structure.
        
**3. Loop Through Websites**

        - The script iterates through each website in the **websites** array.
        
        - For each website, it uses OpenSSL to retrieve the SSL certificate expiration date.
        
        - It then calculates the remaining days until expiration.
        
**4. Color Coding**

        - Based on the number of days until expiration, the script assigns a color to the status.
        
        - Green indicates a comfortable amount of time until expiration.
        
        - Orange indicates a warning level of days until expiration.
        
        - Red indicates that the certificate has already expired.
        
**5. Append Results to HTML Table**

        - The script appends the results for each website to the HTML table, including the website URL, expiration date, and remaining days. The background color of the "Remaining Days" cell reflects the status.
        
**6. Close HTML File**

        - The script finalizes the HTML file by closing the table and body sections.
        
**7. HTML File Output**

        - The final HTML file will be named as specified in output_file and will contain a table with information about each website's SSL certificate, including expiration date and remaining days, color-coded based on the status.
